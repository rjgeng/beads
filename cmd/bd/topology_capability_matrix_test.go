// Front-door capability matrix across storage topologies.
//
// THIS IS A CHARACTERIZATION TEST. Every expectation below records what bd
// does TODAY, including the behavior that is wrong. It is green because it
// describes the present, not because the present is good. Rows carrying a
// knownBad string are tracked defects; the slice that fixes one must flip its
// expectation in the same diff, and that flip is the review artifact proving
// the fix landed.
//
// Do NOT "fix" a failing row by relaxing it. A red row means behavior moved;
// either the move was intended (flip the row) or it is a regression.
//
// Reading the output: each cell is classified by `matrixOutcome` (what
// happened) and `matrixReason` (why it is allowed to be that way).
// REFUSED_TYPED + design is a deliberate, permanent policy refusal.
// REFUSED_TYPED + unimplemented is a capability gap a later slice closes.
// WRONG_ANSWER and DEGRADED are bugs bd currently ships. The distinction is
// the whole point of this file: the refusal surface today mixes all three and
// a reader cannot otherwise tell them apart.
//
// The `reason` column is the test's own authority. Production does not yet
// carry a Reason field on its refusals; when it does, this test should assert
// that the two agree.
